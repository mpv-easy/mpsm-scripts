It also supports additional functionality like automatic file cleanup and the ability to remember the last file played in the torrent. See the readme for more information. See [here](https://github.com/noctuid/mpv-webtorrent-hook#comparison-with-webtorrent-mpv-hook) for a comparison with the other javascript webtorrent plugin. I recommend this plugin over my others (mpv-peerflix-hook and btfs-stream).",
